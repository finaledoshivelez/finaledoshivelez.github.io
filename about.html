	    I've always enjoyed how words and stories can take us to new
	    places and change how we see old ones.  When I was two, I
	    refused to let my parents return an illustrated version of
	    the Wizard of Oz to the library for six months.  By the time
	    I finished elementary school, I'd read our Merriam-Webster
	    dictionary cover-to-cover over ten times--and every book in
	    the children's section of our library.

	    In college, I minored in creative writing.  I also had the
	    pleasure of being part of the Cambridge Writers of Imaginative
	  Literature during my masters in the UK, during which time I
	    published a few short works.

	    These days, I'm a professor in Computer Science at Harvard
	    University.  I develop new techniques in artificial
	    intelligence, with applications to healthcare and
	    technology policy.  I love how an important part of my job
	    involves communicating with undergraduate and graduate
	    students in computer science, policy makers and legal
	    scholars, clinicians and hospital administrators, business
	    executives, even primary school students.  If you're
	    curious about the left brain of my life, check out
	    my <a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard
	    website</a> and
